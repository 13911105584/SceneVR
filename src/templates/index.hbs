        question: "How do I edit my scenes?",
        answer: "You can make changes by going back to your Google spreadsheet. Changes you make to the spreadsheet are automatically available to your Scene. You do not need to repeat the 'publish to the web' step (step #2). If you want to make changes to the optional settings, you will need to update your embed code, but if you are only changing content in the spreadsheet, then there's nothing else to do.",

        question: "What web browsers does SceneVR work with?",
        answer: "Our primary development and testing browser is Google Chrome. We adhere closely to web standards, so we believe that SceneVR should work effectively in all modern web browsers. SceneVR is known to not work with Internet Explorer versions before IE10.",

        				SceneVR is an engaging way to tell stories from an entirely new perspective. It turns your collection of panoramic and VR-ready photos into a series of navigable scenes, allowing you to create unique 360Â° narratives. A simple-to-use editor allows you to order your photos, add descriptions and add text. Your stories can then easily be embedded and viewed anywhere using simple and intuitive controls. Best of all, because SceneVR runs entirely in your browser, your stories can be viewed on desktop, mobile devices and even the most popular VR devices without the need for any extra apps or plugins.
