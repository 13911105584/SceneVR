# SceneVR
SceneVR is an engaging way to tell stories from an entirely new perspective. SceneVR turns your collection of panoramic and VR-ready photos into a series of navigable scenes, allowing you to create unique 360Â° narratives. A simple-to-use editor allows you to order your photos, add descriptions, and attach text right onto your pictures. Your stories can then be easily embedded and viewed anywhere using simple and intuitive controls. And best of all, because SceneVR runs entirely in your browser, your stories can be viewed on desktop, mobile devices and even the most popular VR devices without the need for any extra apps or plugins.
